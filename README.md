# COLOR-DETECTION-MODEL
Color detection is a fascinating field that has numerous applications in various industries, including fashion, web design, image processing, and more. As part of my CodeClause virtual internship, I'm working on a color detection project that uses Python and OpenCV.

#### Project Description :
   The project involves using programming and image processing tools to read the RGB values of a user-selected pixel, match it to the closest color in a CSV file, and display the color and its RGB values on the screen. This project has practical applications in various fields, such as web design, where designers can use it to select color schemes for their website design, and fashion, where color detection technology can help designers match colors and fabrics more accurately.

#### Technology used :
- Python
- Opencv
- Pandas

#### Applications :
- ##### Medical diagnosis : 
Color detection models can be used in medical diagnosis to detect the presence of abnormal coloration in tissues. For example, a color detection model can be used to detect the presence of jaundice by analyzing the color of a patient's skin
- ##### Quality Control in manufacturing and production : 
Color detection is used to ensure product consistency and quality by detecting color variations in products.
- ##### Agriculture Color detection : 
It can be used to identify crop diseases and pests, determine crop maturity and monitor plant growth.
- ##### Robotics : 
Robots use color detection to identity objects and navigate through the environment
